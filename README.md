# Open2D
2D Game Engine Built in SDL 1.2 for a multiplatform game engine. 
NOTE: SDL2 and OpenGL Direct Rendering WILL be used later on. These would replace the rough engine made in a month.

What's Available?: 
New Engine Under Development. Beta Minimal Edition would be released in about a month.

Why this?:
Its a new engine that is controlled by the users, hence letting them fix bugs and a quick drive to 
make it as good as possible.
